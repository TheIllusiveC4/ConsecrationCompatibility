## Overview
Consecration - Compatibility Add-on is an add-on mod for [Consecration](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/consecration). It adds compatibility between Consecration and other mods for Consecration's holy and undying mechanics. The mod compatibility from the original 1.12.2 Consecration was extracted into this separate add-on to isolate integration away from the core codebase. As such, the base Consecration mod is a required dependency for this one to function.

Note that some mods may be made compatible with only Consecration's configuration options, so look through that avenue first before making a new compatibility request.
